# CampusNav

This project implements Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path between various locations on a campus. It is designed to help users navigate efficiently by providing the shortest routes based on given distances between locations.

Features
Input starting and destination locations by their IDs.
Outputs the shortest path and total distance between the two locations.
Provides the return path from the destination back to the starting location.
Locations
The following locations are included in the navigation system:

CSIT
Girls Common Room
Auditorium
Admin Block
Bank
Medical Dept
Library
Engineering Dept
Cafeteria
Sports Complex
Main Gate
How to Use
Clone the repository or download the source code.
Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.

g++ -o campus_navigator campus_navigator.cpp

./campus_navigator
Enter the starting location ID (0 for CSIT) and the destination location ID.
The program will display the shortest path and the distance.
Technologies Used

# Shortest Path Finder for Campus Navigation

This project implements Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path between various locations on a campus. It is designed to help users navigate efficiently by providing the shortest routes based on given distances between locations.
## Features

-Input starting and destination locations by their IDs

-Outputs the shortest path and total distance between the two locations.

-Provides the return path from the destination back to the starting location.

# Campus Navigator - Shortst path finding Algorithm

This project is more than just code; itâ€™s a reflection of my passion for solving real-world challenges. Using Dijkstra's Algorithm, I designed a tool to simplify campus navigation, enabling users to find the shortest path between key locations with ease.

It started as an idea to make my campus feel a little more connectedâ€”and along the way, it became a personal achievement, combining the theoretical with the practical.
## Features

Shortest Path Calculation: Finds the most efficient route between two locations on campus.

User-Friendly Experience: Simple menu to select destinations and receive detailed results.

Bidirectional Path Mapping: Ensures accurate two-way connections between all locations.

Scalable Design: Ready for adding more locations and features in the future.

## Future Enhancements

Add more locations and richer campus details.

Develop a graphical interface for better visualization.

Optimize the algorithm for larger, more complex datasets.
## Deployment

How to Use
-Clone the repository or download the source code.
-Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
-Compile the code

```bash
  
g++ -o campus_navigator campus_navigator.cpp


```

Run the executable

```bash
./campus_navigator
```


## Acknowledgements
Thanks to the contributors of Dijkstra's algorithm for the foundational algorithm used in this project.


## how it works

Graph Representation: Campus locations are treated as nodes, and paths between them are weighted edges.

Shortest Path Finder: The program calculates the shortest route from CSIT to the selected destination.

Visualization: Displays the total distance and an easy-to-follow path.

## Developers Note

This project is a reminder that even small ideas can have a big impact. For me, it wasnâ€™t just about writing codeâ€”it was about proving to myself that I could take an idea and make it real, even when I didnâ€™t love the process.

Truth be told, I hate coding. But if this project inspires someone like meâ€”someone who feels disconnected from the world of programmingâ€”to take a step closer to it, then my work is done.

Thank you for reading, and happy exploring! ðŸ˜Š
